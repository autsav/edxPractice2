				<h2>HTML / CSS</h2>
				<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is essential to modern web browsing. Its essential language that browsers utilize to present information is the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The most current version, HTML5, is coupled with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to improve page layout and style.
					The fundamentals of HTML and CSS are delivered in very simple detail. Covered components are broken down to demonstrate successful implementation. Each module builds upon the last to provide a comprehensive whole.</p>

				<h2>Python Programming</h2>
				<p>Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. Python is a general-purpose programming language. Created nearly 30 years ago, it is now one of the most popular languages out there to use. Its popularity is particularly important in the data science and machine learning fields. But it is also a language that is easy to learn, and that’s why it has become the language most taught in universities.

					Python interpreters are available for the main operating systems as well (Linux, Mac OS, Windows, Android, iOS, BSD, etc.) so it’s very flexible in where it is used. Python has a simple syntax that makes it suitable for learning to program as a first language. The learning curve is smoother than other languages such as Java, which quickly requires learning about Object Oriented Programming or C/C++ that require understanding pointers. Still, it's possible to learn about OOP or functional programming in Python when the time comes	</p>
